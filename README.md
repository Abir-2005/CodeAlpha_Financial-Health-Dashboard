FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD
------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:-
This project presents an interactive dashboard for visualizing and analyzing the financial performance of four companies: AlphaTech, BetaSoft, CodeWorks, and DataPro. The dashboard provides key insights into income, balance sheets, and cash flow to help users understand the financial health and trends of each company.

DATA SOURCE:-
The analysis is based on a sample financial dataset provided in three separate CSV files, which include:
  1) IncomeStatement.csv: Contains monthly records of revenue, expenses, and net profit for each company                             and their departments from 2016 to 2023.
  2) BalanceSheet.csv: Provides a snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity for each company at various                         quarter-end dates from 2016 to 2023.
  3) CashFlow.csv: Details the monthly cash inflows, outflows, and net cash flow for each company from                        2016 to 2023.

HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY INSIGHTS:-
  1) Profitability Trends: The dashboard helps you see which companies and departments are making the                              most money. For example, you can see how AlphaTech's Sales department                                   generated a high net profit of \$75,395 in February 2021. You can also                                  identify months where a company lost money, like when AlphaTech's Operations                            department had a net profit loss of \$1,828 in March 2016.

  2) Financial Health Check: You can quickly see a company's financial health by looking at its assets,                              liabilities, and equity. The data shows when companies had more                                         liabilities than assets, leading to negative equity. For instance,                                      CodeWorks' equity was negative in September 2016 (-$59,361) and March 2017                              (-$37,598).

  3) Cash Flow Management: The dashboard shows how much cash is flowing in and out of each company.                                This helps you understand how well they are managing their money. For                                   example, BetaSoft's cash flow was negative in February 2016 (-$39,355),                                 indicating they spent more cash than they brought in that month. Conversely,                            you can see strong cash flow months, such as CodeWorks' net cash flow of                                \$65,259 in May 2019.
